# Notes and documentation
notes: |
  This profile is designed for a React/TypeScript project with:
  - Source code in src/ and lib/
  - Tests alongside source files
  - Documentation in markdown
  - External dependencies from GitHub
  - AI-powered transformations for better context
  
  Usage:
  copytree --profile example-profile
  
  Customization:
  - Adjust file size limits based on your needs
  - Enable/disable transformers for performance
  - Modify external sources for your dependencies

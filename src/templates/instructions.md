This XML document represents the directory structure and contents of a project, which you will analyze to answer user questions. To reference any file clearly and consistently in your responses, use the @ symbol followed by its relative path from the project rootâ€”e.g., @README.md for the root README file, @src/app.js for a file in the src directory, or @docs/usage/basic-usage.md for a nested documentation file. This @relative/path/to/file.ext notation avoids ambiguity and aligns with the prefixed path attributes in ct:file tags.

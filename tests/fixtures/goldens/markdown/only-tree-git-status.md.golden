## Instructions

<!-- copytree:instructions-begin name="default" -->
```text
This XML document represents the directory structure and contents of a project, which you will analyze to answer user questions. Reference files using @ followed by the relative path from the project root (e.g., @README.md, @src/app.js). The @ notation must not be enclosed in backticks. For example, always write "...in the file @app/page.tsx..." and never "...in the file `@app/page.tsx`...". You can also reference directories with @directory/path to instruct the agent to examine multiple files.
```
